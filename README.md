# Light-Tie-Link-CPU-Memory-System-in-Verilog
A Verilog-based simulation of a simple CPU-to-memory communication system using a Light Tie Link. Implements basic write/read transactions with proper handshaking and waveform verification in Vivado. Great for learning bus-level interactions in RTL design.
